# Egg-Hunting

This was created for Easter Sunday. The purpose of this program is to have fun. It all starts with the first person (Mom). I will give the password, and she should get a prompt. She has to guess which room this prompt is locating her to. When she finds the right room, and gets the next passcode, dad, the next person in line, will use the password, and get a different prompt. Then when it's my turn, I will use the passcode, and solve the prompt, which leads me to the eggs, in this case, donuts. Everyone wins.
